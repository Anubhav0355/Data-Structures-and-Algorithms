2. Write algorithms on your own, dont just dont copy it from Geeks for Geeks or any other site , use your knowledge (or what you have learnt so far) to write , in this way you will be able to practise
and learn from others.
3. And the most important thing dont add codes or algortihms which is already present in the repo.
