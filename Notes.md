## Prefix array can be used for range queries with no updates
* Prefix sum and prefix XOR can be used for range queries.
* Prefix min and max can be made but they can't be used for queries as their inverse doesn't exists( for example the inverse of addition is subtraction and the inverse of Xor is itself).
* For min-max range queries segment trees can be used.
